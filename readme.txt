This plugin works with GeoDirectory plugin to create iPhone and Android mobile apps.

== Description ==

This plugin let's you create a native mobile app for iOS and Android using GeoDirectory and WordPress. Converts your categories and listings to app pages. Native apps enable features just for mobile, for example, customers can bookmark their favorite items and places and you can send notifications to users that display on their home screen.

To get your app in the app store and publish your app, you will need a subscription to a TSL plan. Each Plan includes unlimited push notifications, marketing tools and app store metrics.

This plugin works with Mobile App Manager and GeoDirectory plugs.  To get started, install and activate the Mobile App Manager plugin from [Tiny Screen Labs](https://tinyscreenlabs.com/) The service allows you to design and preview your mobile app with your team and clients. The publishing service is a paid subscription to submit your mobile app to the stores and manage all updates for iOS and Android.
